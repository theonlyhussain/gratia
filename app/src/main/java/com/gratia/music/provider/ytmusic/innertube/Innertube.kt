/**
 * Minimal Innertube (youtubei) client.
 *
 * Two kinds of client identity, for different reasons:
 *
 *  - **WEB_REMIX** against music.youtube.com for browse/search/library. It
 *    returns the full YT Music shelf layout and honours the signed-in session.
 *
 *  - **A device client** for the `player` endpoint, chosen per call. Which
 *    ones Google answers changes without notice, so [player] takes the
 *    identity as an argument and [StreamResolver] walks a list of them rather
 *    than betting the app on any single one. See [PlayerClient].
 *
 * Authenticated requests are signed with Google's SAPISIDHASH scheme derived
 * from the stored cookie; no long-lived token is ever minted or stored.

     * The app clients [StreamResolver] walks through are answered *because*
     * they look like anonymous devices; attaching the session cookie to one
     * of those is what gets it turned away with `LOGIN_REQUIRED`. Nothing
     * about the account is needed to fetch audio through them — history is
     * credited separately, by [playbackTracking] and the stats pings, which
     * do carry the session.
     *
     * [authenticated] is the deliberate exception, and there are two callers of
     * it. [PlayerClient.WEB_REMIX] is a browser identity, and a browser without
     * the session cookie a signed-in listener actually has is the thing that
     * reads as suspicious, not the other way around.
     *
     * The second is an age gate. A device client refused with "Sign in to
     * confirm your age" has already told us the anonymous request will not be
     * answered, so there is nothing left to protect by withholding the session
     * — and everything to gain, because the device clients return *unciphered*
     * `url` fields. That is the only route to an age-restricted track that does
     * not depend on solving a signature. See [StreamResolver.playerStream].
     *
     * Only meaningful with [cookie] set — a caller asking for it while signed
     * out gets the same unauthenticated request as everything else.
